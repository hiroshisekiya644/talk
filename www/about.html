			<h2>Talk</h2>
			<p>Talk is a free video call service for the web.</p>
			<p>Talk uses WebRTC for video communication and a socket.io server that serves as a signaling server. It uses WebRTC mesh when more people are added to the call, it means each video stream in a group call uses a separate P2P connection. There is no hard limit on the number of people in the group video call, but the quality of the call will decrease when more than 6 people join the call.</p>
			<h3>Contact</h3>
			<p>This service is created by <a href="https://vasanthv.com" target="_blank">Vasanth.V</a>. <a href="mailto:hi@vasanthv.com">Contact me</a> if you are interested in using this video call feature in your
				product or service</p>
			<h3>Legal</h3>

			<h3>Privacy policy</h3>
			<p>
				We limit ourselves to collect the smallest amount of user data that we need in order to
				create a seamless experience when using Talk. This data includes:
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCIceCandidate" target="_blank">
					RTCICECandidates
				</a>
				&
				<a
					href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCSessionDescription"
					target="_blank"
				>
					RTCSessionDescription
				</a>
				which is needed to establish the video call using WebRTC. Also, both RTCICECandidates &
				RTCSessionDescription is not stored in any persistent database, it's removed from the server
				as soon as the user closes the browser window.
			</p>
			<p>Talk is purely peer-to-peer, which means the user's video & audio is not sent to our server at all. We use Google Analytics to track
				aggregated usage statistics in order to improve our service.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				The maker of Talk has no intention of using personally or selling any of the
				above-mentioned data.
